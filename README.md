# T'sup ✌️

I'm a developer graduated in the Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul with experience in web, mobile and desktop development,
currently I am working as a software engineer at [Flash](https://flashapp.com.br).

Sometimes I will work in personal projects that I found fun.
For all my projects I use C++ if memory/speed is a problem, Flutter for mobile, ReactJS for web frontend and Python for the rest.
